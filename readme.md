# BoxStore Project

In this project I chose a data that had data from a box-store. This dataset had details about the products that the store sells, such as the brand, the product, model number of the product, serial number of the product, price of the item and more.

* I will be using MS Excel to normalize the data. This will help us better understand the data.

* Then I will be using MySql for creating a database to store this data.

* I will be creating some additional data to make the project more realistic.
