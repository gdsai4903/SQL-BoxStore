# BoxStore Project

In this project I chose a data that had data from a box-store. This dataset had details about the products that the store sells, such as the brand, the product, model number of the product, serial number of the product, price of the item and more.
## Step 1: Normalize the Data:
* I will use MS Excel to normalize the data. The data in its original format is just a single table that has all the information. This not a good way to store data, as it makes the data more redundant and consumes alot of space. Instead we will split this data into several smaller tables which will reduce repetition of data and makes the data more readable. This will also result in a better performance.
## Step 2: Storing the data:
* Then I will be using MySql for creating a database to store this data. MySql is a great option for this case as it gives me the ability to create the database on my local machine, and i
* I will be creating some additional data to make the project more realistic.
